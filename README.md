Homekit
=======
Initial homekit implementation!

Installing
----------
[First install homebridge - instructions here](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge#installation)

More to come

Important note
--------------
All of the smarts in your fan will continue to operate - eg. If you set homekit and your fan's local settings set to turn the light on when occupancy is sensed, and then decide to turn it off via homekit the local settings will _still_ turn the light on
